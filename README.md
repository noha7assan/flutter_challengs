# 🚀 Flutter Challenges – Interactive UI Demos

This Flutter project showcases three creative UI challenges designed to explore animation, interaction, and task management. Each screen demonstrates a unique concept using Flutter's powerful widget system.

## 📱 Screens Included

### ✅ Task Manager
A simple to-do list app with:
- Task completion using checkboxes
- Swipe-to-delete with confirmation
- Undo deletion via SnackBar
- Reordering tasks with drag-and-drop

📍 File: `lib/task_manager.dart`

---

### 🔄 Animation Chain
A loading indicator with animated dots:
- Three dots animate in sequence
- Each dot scales and fades smoothly
- Uses `Interval` and `CurvedAnimation` for staggered timing

📍 File: `lib/anmation_chain.dart`  
🔧 *Tip: Rename to `animation_chain.dart` for clarity*

---

### 🧲 Physics Drag & Drop
A drag-and-drop color matching game:
- Drag colored balls into matching containers
- Visual feedback with shadows and opacity
- Wrong match triggers a red SnackBar

📍 File: `lib/physic_drag.dart`  
🔧 *Tip: Rename to `physics_drag.dart` for clarity*
